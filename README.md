# regularized adaptive feature thresholding (RAFT)
create design files using create_design.m
run a model using all_ML.m

randomeffects2.m was used to create simulated data files
looper.m is an example of how multiple different model types might be run while simulating data on the fly

Some of the code used here was not written by me, but comes from other sources. Authors will always be listed in the .m file itself.
To run the majority of this code you will also need to download the following:
% boostrapal.m (included in this repository)
% glmnet - http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet_matlab/
% fastAUC - http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/42860-fast-auc-calculator-and-roc-curve-plotter/content/fastAUC.m
